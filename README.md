# Algorithmic complexity analysis

This was one of two courseworks required for my advanced software engineering module at university.
There were two key parts to this coursework:
1) Creating a solution to the royal software engineers algorithm (a variation of the 3 million men algorithm) that minimises time complexity
2) Creating a solution to the royal mathematicians algorithm. This was similar to the royal software engineers algorithm but instead focussed on reducing space complexity.

This coursework focussed on recongising asymptotic notation, specifically the big O notation and identifying how to minimise run-time where possible.
